            <h1>Check out my borders</h1>

            <p>We've modified the content div to have a 1px darkgrey border with rounded corners of an 8px radius.</p>

            <p>Other elements can have borders too, <span class="red-border">like this span with class red-border</span>.</p>

            <hr>

            <p>You can change the color of horizontal rules by changing the border color;<br>
all horizontal rules are now #CFDFE4</p>

        </div>

        <p>Notice how the borders double up here:</p>
        <div class="red-border">This div has a red border</div>
        <div class="blue-border">This div has a blue border</div>

        <p>Notice how this fixes the borders:</p>

        <div class="red-border2">This div has a red border, except on the bottom, and 8px round top corners</div>
        <div class="blue-border2">div has a blue border, and 8px round bottom corners</div>

    </body>
